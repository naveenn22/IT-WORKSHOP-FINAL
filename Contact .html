        <h1>My Personal Experience with Physical Fitness</h1> 

        
        <h2>A Small History </h2><p>
            
            
            On february 16th 2019, I have started my fitness journey. Have been active since childhood by adding dance, Soccer, Hiking in my daily life.<br>
        I was lean in my teenage. Friends use to make fun of me. I was lacking confidence when it comes to studies or taking stand for justice when needed.<br><br>
        <img src="fitness.jpg" style="float: right;" width="420" height="400">
        Gone through a bad situation in my life in my final year of my Graduation. I was in deep pain
        ignored studies, sports, family outings.<BR> I was totally lost.
        Right from my childhood I was very fascinated about being active. One day my friend who is fit challenged me <br>on doing 30 pushups on single go.<br><br>
        He critisized me that I wouldnt be able to more than 15. But i turned it to 32 and evrybody was shocked. All of it was possible because of my zeal towards that goal to prove him wrong.
        That day he suggested me to start everything from scratch, to build a new version of me, to destress my pain on to something which can serve benefits to me.<br><br>
        It was 16th feb 2019 when I got myself tuned towards Weight - Training for building a new version of me. Growing and Building confidence from mistakes which i do on daily bases. 
        Dedication towards my fitness journey made me realize importance of targets, Discipline in your preparation and patience to your acheivements.<br></p>
        
        <h2>My Transformation</h2>
        <p>I was lean but with descent muscle mass in my teenage. When I started weight training I was weighing 63 kgs and height of <br>5 Feet 8 inches. First 3 months I was training in a gym nearby my home, DEADLIFT.<br><br>
        I couldnt able tO form good bonding with trainers at that gym. Soon then shifted to new gym, FORCE FITNESS STUDIO nearby and i've been training from that day and still counting at present.<br><br>
        Gained for about 3 kgs in first 3 months. Gaining at a good rate of lean muscle mass. When shifted to Force, I had the best Trainer in my life, he trained me according to my body's response and also helped me to focus on my life Mentally.<br><br>
        Exercising muscles and hitting them with various Isometric and Compound Exercises made me to gain good muscle mass in the next 3 months.<br>
        Adding Cross fit and increasing frequancy of training body parts and understanding and maintaining a good diet led me to build a good athletic structure by the end of one year of my Fitness Journey.<br><br>
        There is a drastic change in strength, confidence, discipline, immunity, determination on goals, dedication towards interests.<br><br>
        Its 1.5 year for now weighing 75Kgs and height of 5 Feet 10 Inches with good Athletic structure. I Have gathered a wide range of information related to health lifestyle.<br>
        Learnt a lot from mistakes. I believe Getting better everyday counts for becoming the best version of yourself.
        Fitness helped me to rebuild my life and know the value of it.<br>
