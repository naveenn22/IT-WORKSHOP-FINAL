        <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-coIemsscxdY/UnkEjZJAHiI/AAAAAAAAH1g/ONI-LibqnFk/s640/today+is+your+day.png" style="float: right;" width="420px" height="250px" > <!--Quote Image-->
         <p style="font-size:large;">Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects
                 of sports, occupations and daily activities.<br> Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition,
                 moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest.<br> Before the industrial revolution, fitness was defined
                  as the capacity to carry out the day’s activities without undue fatigue.<br> However, with automation and changes in 
                lifestyles physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability<br> to function efficiently and effectively 
                in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases,<br> and to meet emergency situations.</p><!--Intro Paragraph-->

        <h2 style="font-size: x-large ;"><strong>Types of Training : </strong></h2><p>Aerobis Exercise & Anaerobic Exercise</p>
        <h2>Aerobic Exercise</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large;"><em>Aerobic exercise, which improves cardiorespiratory fitness, involves movement that increases the heart rate to improve
             the body's oxygen consumption.</em></p>
                <ol style="font-size: large;"><strong>Here are some examples</strong></ol><!--List of Aerobic-->

                    <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jogging">Jogging</a></strong> -Running at a steady and gentle pace. This form of exercise is great for maintaining weight and building a cardiovascular base to later perform more intense exercises.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking">Walking</a></strong> - Moving at a fairly regular pace for a short, medium or long distance.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)">Swimming</a></strong> - Using the arms and legs to keep oneself afloat and moving either forwards or backward. This is a good full-body exercise for those who are looking to strengthen their core while improving cardiovascular endurance.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling">Cycling</a></strong> - Riding a bicycle typically involves longer distances than walking or jogging. This is another low-impact exercise on the joints and is great for improving leg strength.</li>
        <h2>Anaerobic Exercise</h2>
            <p style="font-size: large;"><em>Anaerobic exercise features high-intensity movements performed in a short period of time. It is a fast, high-intensity exercise that doesn’t require the body to utilize oxygen to produce energy.</em></p>

                <ol style="font-size: large;"><strong>Here are some examples</strong></ol><!--List of Anaerobic-->
                    <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_training">Weight Training</a></strong> - A common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_exercise">Isometric exercise</a></strong> - Helps to maintain strength. A muscle action in which no visible movement occurs and the resistance matches the muscular tension.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)">Sprinting</a></strong> - Running short distances as fast as possible.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_training">Interval training</a></strong> - alternating short bursts (lasting around 30 seconds) of intense activity with longer intervals (three to four minutes) of less intense activity.</li>
