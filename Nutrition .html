        <h1 >ALL ABOUT NUTRITION</h1><br>
        <h2>What is nutrition and why does it matter?</h2>
        <p >Nutrition is the study of nutrients in food, how the body uses them, and the relationship between diet, health, and disease. To get into top physical shape, fuelling your body is as important as training it.
             Eating the right foods at the right times can optimize your physical performance and give you a competitive edge.<br><br>
            
            Though dietary needs vary from sport to sport, one formula holds true: A fitness-friendly diet must contain carbohydrate for fuel, protein to build and repair muscles and fluids to cool the body.
            
            A fit body also relies on meeting daily requirements for vitamins and minerals, some of which change once you hit 50.<br><br>
            
            If people do not have the right balance of nutrients in their diet, their risk of developing certain health conditions increases. This article will explain the different nutrients a person needs and why.<br><br>
            Nutrients provide nourishment. Proteins, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water are all nutrients. <br><br>It will also look at the role of the dietitian and the nutritionist.</p>

           <h3>MACRONUTRIENTS</h3>
           
           <ul>Macronutrients are nutrients that people need in relatively large quantities.</ul>

                          <li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> : Carbohydrate-rich foods deliver glucose into your bloodstream for immediate energy; the rest is stored in muscles as glycogen - the primary fuel for all types of exercise. The more glycogen your muscles store, the longer you'll be able to continue training before feeling tired.
                    <ol><strong>Sugar, starch, and fiber are types of carbohydrates.</strong>
                        <br><br>

                          <li><em style="background-color: rgba(255, 94, 65, 0.863);">Sugars</em> are simple carbs. The body quickly breaks down and absorbs sugars and processed starch. They can provide rapid energy, but they do not leave a person feeling full. They can also cause a spike in blood sugar levels. Frequent sugar spikes increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and its complications.</li>
                          <li><em style="background-color:rgb(46, 255, 81);">Fiber</em> is also a carbohydrate. The body breaks down some types of fiber and uses them for energ; others are metabolized by gut bacteria, while other types pass through the body.</li>
                          <li><em style="background-color:rgb(46, 255, 81);">Fiber and unprocessed starch</em> are complex carbs. It takes the body some time to break down and absorb complex carbs. After eating fiber, a person will feel full for longer. Fiber may also reduce the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer. Complex carbs are a more healthful choice than sugars and refined carbs.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Proteins</strong> : Proteins consist of amino acids, which are organic compounds that occur naturally.
                    There are 20 amino acids. Some of these are essential, which means people need to obtain them from food. <br><br>The body can make the others.
                    
                    Some foods provide complete protein, which means they contain all the essential amino acids the body needs. Other foods contain various combinations of amino acids.
                    <br>Most plant-based foods do not contain complete protein, so a person who follows a vegan diet needs to eat a range of foods throughout the day that provides the essential amino acids.

                <li><strong>Fats : Fats are essential for </strong>

                    Too much fat can lead to obesity, high cholesterol, liver disease, and other health problems.However, the type of fat a person eats makes a difference. Unsaturated fats, such as olive oil, are more healthful than saturated fats, which tend to come from animals.
                </li><br>
                <li><strong>Water</strong> : 
                The adult human body is up to 60% water, and it needs water for many processes.<br> Water contains no calories, and it does not provide energy.

                Many people recommend consuming 2 liters, or 8 glasses, of water a day, but it can also come from dietary sources, such as fruit and vegetables. Adequate hydration will result in pale yellow urine.<br><br>

                Requirements will also depend on an individualâ€™s body size and age, environmental factors, activity levels, health status, and so on.

                <h3>MICRONUTRIENTS</h3>
                <p>Micronutrients are essential in small amounts. They include vitamins and minerals. Manufacturers sometimes add these to foods. </p>
                    <h4>Essential Micronutrients for Active people</h4>
                    <p><em style="background-color:rgb(85, 249, 255)"> Boost Calcium </em> At 50, daily calcium requirements increase from 1,000 milligrams to 1,500 milligrams. Getting enough calcium - along with a daily 1,000-IU supplement of vitamin D - will help maintain strong bones and prevent stress fractures.

                        Unless you're drinking five cups of milk a day (1,500 milligrams of calcium), you'll need to rely on supplements to ensure an adequate intake.<br>
                        
                        <em style="background-color:rgb(85, 255, 246)"> Get vitamin B12 </em>   Turning 50 also affects your vitamin B12 status. B12 is a nutrient that helps convert protein and carbohydrates into energy that muscles can use. Even a small deficiency can result in reduced performance and recovery.
                        
                        Studies suggest that up to 30 per cent of people over 50 may not produce enough stomach acid to properly absorb B12 from foods. The daily recommended intake is 2.4 micrograms.<br>
                        
                        <em style="background-color:rgb(85, 255, 241)"> Include Iron </strong></em>  Men and women require eight milligrams of iron each day to help maintain high energy and concentration. Good sources of iron include red meat, enriched breakfast cereals, whole grain breads, dried fruit, legumes, tofu and nuts. A daily multivitamin and mineral supplement will also help you meet daily iron needs.</p>
