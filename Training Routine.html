        <p>The basic principles of weight training are essentially identical to those of strength training,
             and involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions (reps), sets, tempo, exercise types, 
             and weight moved to cause desired increases in strength, endurance, and size.<br> 
             The specific combinations of reps, sets, exercises, and weights depends on the aims of the individual performing the exercise.</p>
