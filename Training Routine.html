        <h1>An Overview of WEIGHT TRAINING</h1>

        <h2>What is Weight Training ? </h2>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Weight training involves using some type of resistance to do a variety of exercises designed to challenge all your muscle groups, 
            including your chest, back, shoulder, biceps, triceps, core, legs (quadriceps, hamstrings, calves) and glutes.<br> 
             The specific combinations of reps, sets, exercises, and weights depends on the aims of the individual performing the exercise.<br>
             Weight training can be performed with free weights, such as barbells and dumbbells, or by using weight machines.<br></p>
             <p>The idea of weight training is that, when you use more resistance than your body normally handles, your muscles get stronger, 
                 along with your bones and connective tissue, all while building lean muscle tissue.</p>
            <p>You can also increase your strength through other types of resistance exercises, such as by using your body weight or resistance bands.</p>
          
            <h2>The benefits of Weight Training</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Help raise your metabolism—Muscle burns more calories than fat, so the more muscle you have, the more calories you'll burn all day long.</li>
                    <li>Strengthen bones, especially important for women</li>
                    <li>Strengthen connective tissue—As we get older, we need to protect our tendons and ligaments, and a strong body can help you do that.</li>
                    <li>Make you stronger and increase muscular endurance—This makes everyday activities much easier.</li>
                    <li>Increase your confidence and self-esteem</li>
                    <li>Improve coordination and balance</li>
                </ul>
                
                 <h2>The Principles of Weight Training</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/overload-strength-training-1231224" style="font-size: large;">Overload</a> : The first thing you need to do to build lean muscle tissue is to use more resistance than your muscles are used to. This is important because the more you do, the more your body is capable of doing, so you should increase your workload to avoid plateaus.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/exercise-progression-1231067" style="font-size: large;">Progression</a> : To avoid plateaus or adaptation, you need to increase your intensity regularly. You can do this by increasing the amount of weight lifted, changing your sets/reps, changing the exercises, and/or changing the type of resistance. You can make these changes on a weekly or monthly basis.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/principle-of-specificity-definition-3120375" style="font-size: large;">Specificity</a> : This means you should train for your goal. If you want to increase your strength, your program should be designed around that goal (e.g., train with heavier weights closer to your 1 RM, or 1 rep max). To lose weight, you might want to focus on circuit training, since that may give you the most bang for your buck.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/the-benefits-of-rest-and-recovery-after-exercise-3120575" style="font-size: large;">Rest and Recovery</a> : Rest days are just as important as workout days. It is during these rest periods that your muscles grow and change, so make sure you're not working the same muscle groups two days in a row.</li>

            <h2>Choose your reps and sets</h2>
              <p>You've figured out the exercises you should be doing, but what about the number of sets and repetitions? Your decision should be based on your goals.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For fat loss: One to 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps using enough weight that you can only complete the desired reps.</li>
                    <li>To gain muscle: Three or more sets of 6 to 8 reps to fatigue. For beginners, give yourself several weeks of conditioning before going to this level. You may need a spotter for many exercises.</li>
                    <li>For health and endurance: One to 3 sets of 12 to 16 reps using enough weight that you can only complete the desired reps.</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h2>Resting Between The Exercises</h2>
            <p>Another important part of training is resting between the exercises.4﻿ This comes with experience, but the general rule is, the higher the reps, the shorter the rest.<br>
                 So, if you're doing 15 reps, you might rest about 30 to 60 seconds between exercises. If you're lifting very heavy, say 4 to 6 reps, you may need up to two or more minutes.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Tips For Best Results</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Always warm up before you start lifting weights. This helps get your muscles warm and prevent injury. You can warm up with light cardio or by doing a light set of each exercise before going to heavier weights.</li>
                <li>Lift and lower your weights slowly. Don't use momentum to lift the weight. If you have to swing to get the weight up, chances are you're using too much weight.</li>
                <li>Breathe. Don't hold your breath, and make sure you're using the full range of motion throughout the movement.</li>
                <li>Stand up straight. Pay attention to your posture, and engage your abs in every movement you're doing to keep your balance and protect your spine.></li>
