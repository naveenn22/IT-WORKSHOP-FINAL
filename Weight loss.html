        <h1>An Overview of WEIGHT LOSS</h1>
        <h2>How to Lose Weight Fast: 3 Simple Steps, Based on Science</h2> 
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/0e/85/5d0e855722a170459e602394efaf535e.jpg" style="float: right;" width="300" height="600"> 
       <P>There are many ways to lose a lot of weight fast.<br>

        That said, many diet plans leave you feeling hungry or unsatisfied. These are major reasons why you might find it hard to stick to a diet.<br>
        
        However, not all diets have this effect. Low carb diets are effective for weight loss and may be easier to stick to than other diets.</P>
        <ul>Here’s a 3-step weight loss plan that employs a low carb diet and aims to:
                <li>significantly reduce your appetite</li>
                <li>cause fast weight loss</li>
                <li>Improve your metabolic health at the same time</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>1. Cut back on carbs</h2>
        <p>The most important part is to cut back on sugars and starches, or carbohydrates.<br>

            When you do that, your hunger levels go down, and you generally end up eating significantly fewer calories (1).<br>
            
            Instead of burning carbs for energy, your body now starts burning stored fat for energy.<br>
            
            Another benefit of cutting carbs is that it lowers insulin levels, causing the kidneys to shed excess sodium and water. This reduces bloating and unnecessary water weight (2, 3Trusted Source).<br>
            
            According to some dietitians, it’s not uncommon to lose up to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) — sometimes more — in the first week of eating this way. This weight loss includes both body fat and water weight.<br>
            
            One study in healthy women with obesity reported that a very low carb diet was more effective than a low fat diet for short-term weight loss (4Trusted Source).<br>
            
            Research suggests that a low carb diet can reduce appetite, which may lead you to eat fewer calories without thinking about it or feeling hungry (5).<br>
            
            Put simply, reducing carbs can lead to quick, easy weight loss.</p>
         <h2>2. Eat protein, fat, and vegetables</h2>
         <p>Each one of your meals should include a protein source, fat source, and low carb vegetables.<br>

            As a general rule, try eating two to three meals per day. If you find yourself hungry in the afternoon, add a fourth meal.<br>
            
            Constructing your meals in this way should bring your carb intake down to around 20–50 grams per day.<br>

         <h3>Protein</h3>   
            Eating plenty of protein is an essential part of this plan.<br>

            Evidence suggests that eating lots of protein may boost calorie expenditure by 80–100 calories per day (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).<br>

            High protein diets can also reduce cravings and obsessive thoughts about food by 60%, reduce the desire to snack late at night by half, and make you feel full. In one study, people on a higher protein diet ate 441 fewer calories per day (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).<br>

            When it comes to losing weight, protein is a crucial nutrient to think about.<br>
            Healthy protein sources include:
            <ol id="protlist">
            <li>Meat: beef, chicken, pork, and lamb</li>
            <li> Fish and seafood: salmon, trout, and shrimp</li>
                <li> Eggs: whole eggs with the yolk</li>
                    <li>Plant-based proteins: beans, legumes, and soy </li>
           </ol>  
           <h3>Low carb vegetables</h3>
           
            <p>Don’t be afraid to load your plate with low carb vegetables. They are packed with nutrients and you can eat very large amounts without going over 20–50 net carbs per day.<br>

            A diet based mostly on lean protein sources and vegetables contains all the fiber, vitamins, and minerals you need to be healthy.</p>
            <ol>Many vegetables are low in carbs, including:

                <li>broccoli</li>
                <li>cauliflower</li>
                    <li>spinach</li>
                        <li>tomatoes</li>
                            <li>kale</li>
                                <li>Brussels sprouts</li>
                                    <li>cabbage</li>
                                        <li>Swiss chard</li>
                                            <li>lettuce</li>
                                                <li>cucumber</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Healthy fats</h3>
                Don’t be afraid of eating fats. Trying to do low carb and low fat at the same time can make sticking to the diet very difficult.

              <p><strong>Sources of healthy fats include:</strong></p>
              <ol id="fatlist">

                    <li>olive oil</li>
                    <li>coconut oil</li>
                    <li>avocado oil</li>
                    <li>butter</li>
            </ol> 
            <h2>3. Lift weights three times per week</h2>
                <p>You don’t need to exercise to lose weight on this plan, but it will have extra benefits.<br>

                By lifting weights, you will burn lots of calories and prevent your metabolism from slowing down, which is a common side effect of losing weight (11, 12Trusted Source).<br>

                Studies on low carb diets show that you can gain a bit of muscle while losing significant amounts of body fat (13).<br>

                Try going to the gym three to four times a week to lift weights. If you’re new to the gym, ask a trainer for some advice.<br>

                If lifting weights is not an option for you, doing some cardio workouts like walking, jogging, running, cycling, or swimming will suffice. Both cardio and weightlifting can help with weight loss.<br>

               <h2> What about calories and portion control?</h2>   
                <p>It’s not necessary to count calories as long as you keep your carb intake very low and stick to protein, fat, and low carb vegetables.<br>

                        However, if you want to count them, you can use a free online calculator like this one.<br>

                        Enter your sex, weight, height, and activity levels. The calculator will tell you how many calories to eat per day to maintain your weight, lose weight, or lose weight fast.<br>

                        You can also download free, easy-to-use calorie counters from websites and app stores. Here is a list of 5 calorie counters to try.
